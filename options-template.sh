# Additional Details - How Backups Work
#
# Backups in the container are saved to subdirectories within the directory specified by BACKUP_PATH within the
# container.  The default for this location if /opt/data/backup if that is not overridden in container environment
# variables.
#
# For example, mapping the host path /data/mnb to /opt/data in the container would result in backups to
# /data/mnb/backup/swc/, /data/mnb/backup/sample/, etc. on the host.
#
# For "local" backups, it is assumed to be on the host machine and that docker, as root, is able to mount any path on
# the host as read/write.  Therefore only MNB_LOCAL_BACKUP_LOCATION is required and this location is mapped to
# /opt/data in the container and backups will be to subdirectories in ${MNB_LOCAL_BACKUP_LOCATION}/backup/.
#
# For "remote" backups, it is not assumed that the full path of the backup location is usable by root.  For example,
# root may have access to the mount point of a network share at /mnt/foo but not have read/write access to the desired
# backup location on the share of /mnt/foo/projects/bar/backup/.  Therefore, for remote backups both a host path and the
# container backup path may be specified.
#
# In the example above, MNB_REMOTE_BACKUP_PATH would be set to /mnt/foo to allow the volume mapping to the container (it
# will be mapped to /opt/data) and and MNB_REMOTE_BACKUP_PATH (used to override BACKUP_PATH in the container) would be
# set to /opt/data/projects/bar/backup/ (it is assumed that unlike root on the host, the user in the data-services
# container has read/write access to the final location on the mounted share).
